# carolina-data-challenge-2019
"best insight" winner at the 2019 Carolina Data Challenge

---

Myself and three other students from NC State's Master in Analytics program (Supreet Desphpande, Taylor Kooy, and Meghan Weber) won 1st place in the main even "best insight" at the 2019 Carolina Data Challenge.

One of the avaliable datasets was data about U.S. aggricultural imports and exports. After some research I discovered that one particular product, sorghum, was a crop that the U.S. almost exclusively exported to China in the past, and that trade had dropped to zero due to the trade war. Given this, if we could forecast what exports should have been, we could roughly approximate the loss due to the trade war.
